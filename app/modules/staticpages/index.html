            <h2> What? </h2>

            <p>
                This website provides an interactive exploit development learning area.
                Every user has access to his own, personal Linux container. The container
                can be x32 and x64, with and without ASLR - and even 32 bit and 64 bit ARM.
            </p>

                You dont need to have anything else then a modern browser. Login, select
                <a href="/#challenges">Challenges</a>, and start hacking!
            </p>

            <p>
                Just want to play around? Start your container without a challenge in
                the <a href="/#container">Containers</a> tab.

            You are probably wondering how you'll get an account. If you took the time
            and read all these silly sentences and this filler sentence, I can tell
            you that every username is valid. The only requirement is that the password
            for the user is equal to demo. That's it. But now as as you are in
            possesion of this knowledge, you are required to give me feedback
            on how this thing performs. Thank you very much :-)

            <h2> How? </h2>

            In short: KVM + LXD. <br>
            Together with websockets and xterm.js. <br>
            Glued together with AngularJS and GO.

            <h2> Status? </h2>

            Beta.
